Improvements on vanilla CNNs include skip connections to improve gradient flow, special
architectures like U-nets that are good for image segmentation, or maybe finding a way to get
rotational invariance.

The parameter efficiency of CNNs comes from sharing weights across the entire input instead of
having each weight correspond to a particular pixel.
